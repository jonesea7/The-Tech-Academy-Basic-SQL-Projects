Drills 1-6 are in the appropriately named file.

I needed to redo drill 4 and 6.
The redo are in the SQLdrillRedo file.

And Drill 7 is in a separate file also appropriately named.

(The syntax file is just me mucking around with syntax).

Thanks for all you do!

ProcDrills is a collection of coding exercises that focus on procedure creation. 
It includes:
Parameter establishment
drop/delete procedures
saving computing with SET NO COUNT

TwoJoinsTwoParameters

is the file containing the final result for the drill in the SQL Course with the challenge of 
you guessed it
creating a procedure with two joins and two parameters.
