These are the practice databases from my course for The Tech Academy on SQL in MSSMS.

The file title dBzooDemo.sql should be most helpful for review because I put quite a bit of comments in the code indicating
what was going on with the code.

MyFirstdB is just that and has several styling no-nos that I decided to keep so that I can see how far I have come.
